Urgent|committed location: time not allowed to pass.
Urgent: other transitions may interleave if they do not require time to pass as well.
Committed: only interleavings with other committed states are allowed.

Urgent locations freeze time; i.e. time is not allowed to pass when a process is in an urgent location.
- The location must be left before time can pass;
- Other transitions may happen before, as long as they do not require time to pass.

Committed locations also freeze time; i.e. time is not allowed to pass when a process is in one of them.
- When a model has one or more active committed locations, no transitions other than those leaving said locations can be enabled;
- If several processes are in a committed location at the same time, then they will interleave;
- Committed locations are useful for creating atomic sequences.
