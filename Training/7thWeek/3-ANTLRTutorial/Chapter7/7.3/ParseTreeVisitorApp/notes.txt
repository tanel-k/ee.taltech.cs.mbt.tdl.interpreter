We can build just about anything we want with visitors and listeners. Once we're in the Java space, there's no more ANTLR stuff to learn.
All we have to know is the relationship between a grammar, its parse tree, and the visitor or listener event methods. Beyond that, it's just code.
In response to recognizing input phrases, we can generate output, collect information (as we've done here), validate phrases in some way, or perform computations.

This property file example is small enough that we didn't run into an issue regarding rules with alternatives. By default ANTLR generates a single kind of event for each rule no matter which alternative the parser matches.
That's pretty inconvenient because the listener and visitor methods have to figure out which alternative was matched by the parser.

In the next section, we'll see how to get events at a finer granularity.
