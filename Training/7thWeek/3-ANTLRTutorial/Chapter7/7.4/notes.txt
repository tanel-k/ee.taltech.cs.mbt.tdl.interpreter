Listeners and visitors are great.
We get reusable and retargetable grammars as well as encapsulated language applications just by fleshing out event methods.
ANTLR even automatically generates the skeleton code for us.
It turns out, though, that the applications we've built so far are so simple we haven't run into a common implementation issue, which is that event methods sometimes need to pass around partial results or other information.
