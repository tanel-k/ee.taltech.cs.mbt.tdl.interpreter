A listener-based approach is greate because all of the tree walking and method triggering is done automatically.
Sometimes, though, automatic tree walking is also a weakness because we can't control the walk itself.
For example, we might want to walk a parse tree for a C program, ignoring everything inside functions by skipping the function body subtrees.
Listener event methods also can't use method return values to pass data around.
When we need to control the walk or want to return values with event-method return values, we use a visitor pattern.
